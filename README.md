# CWL - A CloudWatch Logs CLI

CWL helps you monitor CloudWatch logs on the command line.

The default AWS CLI displays logs in JSON format, and while that can
be processed with another tool like `jq`, it's a bit of a pain.

`cwl` tries to make working with AWS CloudWatch logs as easy as
possible by simplifying the parameters and choosing sane defaults.
